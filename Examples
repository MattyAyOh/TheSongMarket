After IPO:
Put song into a bracket
1           - 100,000       - +1,000 (%1)
100,000     - 1,000,000     - +2,500 (%2.5)
1,000,000   - 10,000,000    - +10,000 (%1)
10,000,000  - 100,000,000   - +100,000 (%1)
100,000,000 - 1,000,000,000 - +1,000,000 (%1)

If song doesn't increase by that many views on a daily basis (8AM), then it loses value

EX: Dark Horse has 200,000,000 Views.  Today it only got +500,000 views.
She achieved 50% of the performance minimum, so the song loses -$5

EX2: Panic at the Disco Lying has 12.8 milo views.  Today it got 8,000 views.  That's 8%, meaning their value goes down 92% of 10 = -$9.2.  Minimum of $1 a share

EX3: Unkinder Thumper has 63,000 views. Today got 1,500 views.  that's +50% from the performance minimum.  So it'll get +$5 today

EX4: Ludacris Party Girls has 200,000 views in one day, from release date.  That's a 20000% increase.  Need to handle this appropriately because it'll result in +20,000 on the IPO.
Suggested Reaction:  Wait a week after a song is released to let it's view count settle down in it's appropriate bracket.

EX5: Rita Ora I will never let you down has 8.8 milo.  Gains about 300,000 a day.  3000% increase.  Meaning +$300 on the daily, and even if it moved up a bracket it would be +$30.  That's too much.

Increasing at about 3.33% of it's viewcount a day.

Shakira Empire has 28.8 milo, increases at about 300k a day. (1.034%)

Justin Timberlake not a bad thing - 5.6milo, 160k increase (2.857%)

Dark Horse - 274.5 milo, +3milo (1.093%)

Monster Rihanna - 148 milo +600k (.405%) expecting .98%

John Legend ALl of me - 90.6milo, +900k (.993%)
So here's another case, All of Me has been trending lately, the integral of it's viewcount trends has been increasing, but due to it being uploaded since october 2013, it has had a lot of time to collect views.  The +900k is abnormal for the song, but because it had accumulated a lot of views, the percentage increase isn't a lot.  Need to shift the curve for songs that are older.  Alternatively, can just account for the percentage change in the number of views a day, instead of the percentage the number of daily views is from the total views.

Justin Timberlake TKO 39.8 milo, +100k (.251%)


So maybe we could expect 1% for a song that is less than 3 months old.

But for a song that's older
Longview Green day 1.677 milo, +2000 (.119%)

Maybe for every month, we expect .010 less.  So 55 month old video, we expect .450% increase, instead of 1%.  Song is still going down though, it should be almost stagnant.

What if we expect .02 less.  But that means that we are expecting -.100%.  Which doesn't make any sense.  So we gotta put a floor cap on that.  If the floor cap is at .100, then green day will make .119/.100 = 1.19.  But we only want it to go up $.119, so formula looks like

Performance/Expected/10



Or, could see it as song is performing +.019% higher than expectations.


Okay, so let's try that.  Go back to Justin Timberlake Mirrors has 184 milo views, +250k a day. (.136%) increase.  Song has been out for 14 months.  11 months.  .22 less, so we expect .78%.

1-(.136/.78)= .174 (.826)
Or, could rephrase to say that song is performing -.644% from expectations.

Mirrors is performating at 17.435% of it's projection and only would lose a penny in value a day.  Need to balance this a little more


Formula should be different if it's under performing

performance^3/expected^3/10

Expecting 1%
2% +10
3% +30 27/1 ~ 2.70

We will probably want to update twice a day, which will change the entire algorithm, as well.
